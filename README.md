Description:
During my time in the TechPro bootcamp, I undertook a project aimed at enhancing my proficiency in web development by creating an interactive quiz application. The project, aptly named "FunFact Quiz," was designed to consolidate my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while simultaneously providing an engaging learning experience.

Key Features:

    User-Friendly Interface: The quiz interface was crafted with a user-centric approach, ensuring intuitive navigation and seamless interaction.
    Dynamic Question Generation: Leveraging JavaScript, the quiz dynamically generated a variety of questions, ensuring each quiz session was unique and challenging.
    Responsive Design: Employing CSS techniques, the quiz application boasted a responsive design, rendering flawlessly across devices of varying screen sizes.
    Feedback Mechanism: Upon completion of the quiz, users received instant feedback, including their overall score and performance breakdown.
    Interactive Elements: To enrich the user experience, interactive elements such as timers, progress bars, and animations were incorporated, enhancing engagement and immersion.

Technologies Utilized:

    HTML: Structured the content and layout of the quiz application.
    CSS: Styled the user interface, ensuring aesthetic appeal and consistency.
    JavaScript: Implemented the logic behind question generation, user interaction, and result calculation.
